## About the Project  
**RustyChain** is a simple blockchain built using safe, modern Rust.   
It’s ideal for Rust developers like myself or blockchain enthusiasts looking to grasp key concepts like:  

- Block creation and immutability,   
- SHA-256 hashing,  
- Chain validation,  
- Genesis block architecture,  

----------------------------  

## Features  

 Immutable Block structure  
 Hash-linked chain  
 Timestamped block data (via chrono)  
 JSON-serializable chain output  
 Modular code with `block`, `blockchain`, `main`  

----------------------------  

## Built With  

| Tool/Crate   | Purpose             |  
|-------------|---------------------|  
| [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) | A cool Systems programming language |  
| [chrono](https://crates.io/crates/chrono) | Timestamp (Date & time handling) |  
| [sha2](https://crates.io/crates/sha2)     | SHA-256 hashing |  
| [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde)   | Serialization framework |  
| [serde_json](https://crates.io/crates/serde_json) | JSON encoding |
