## About the Project  
**RustyChain** is a simple blockchain built using safe, modern Rust.   
It’s ideal for Rust developers like myself or blockchain enthusiasts looking to grasp key concepts like:  

- Block creation and immutability,   
- SHA-256 hashing,  
- Chain validation,  
- Genesis block architecture,  

----------------------------  

## 🚀 Features  

✅ Immutable Block structure  
🔗 Hash-linked chain  
🕒 Timestamped block data (via chrono)  
📄 JSON-serializable chain output  
📦 Modular code with `block`, `blockchain`, `main`  

----------------------------  

## 🛠️ Built With  

| Tool/Crate   | Purpose             |
